Where as a traditional variable represents one value at any given time, streams represent many values, over time.

  --o--o---o--o--o--o---X

o's represent individual values, - represent time. X represents the end of a stream, perhaps the end of a program's execution.

In this adventure we'll use Kefir, a simple and light implementation of a stream.

To get started, open up a new file, and export a function:

module.exports = function () {
 // ..
}

Have your function return:

  "there are no paths paths are made by walking"

Save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.

Don't overthink this.
