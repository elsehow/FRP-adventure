NICE! here was my solution:

  function deliciousness (batch) {
    return batch.deliciousness
  }

  module.exports = function (batches) {
    return batches.map(JSON.parse).map(deliciousness)
  }

Streams are a way of reasoning about the many values a variable takes on throughout the course of a program. The same way a channel lets us reason about many individual transmissions, or a river lets us reason about many individual water molecules. It allows us to see a sequence of events at a different level of granularity, so that we can more easily talk about processes a number of atomic elements.
