Imagine a Kefir stream:

  --o--o---o--o--o--o---X

Kefir streams expose a function called `map`. It works similarly to the native JS implementation (Array.prototype.map)

So, if I have a `stream` like this:

  --1--2---3--4--5--6---X

I can use `map` to double every element that comes through `stream`:

  function double (x) { return x*2 }
  stream.map(double)

Then I'll get this stream:

  --2--4---6--8--10-12---X

You and your friends are cookie-baking hobbiests. You've set up an announcement server whereby anyone who's baked a batch of cookies can announce them. 

Announcements look like this:

  { baker: 'elsehow'
  , flavor: 'triple choco dilemma'
  , deliciousness: 7 }

I'll pass you a Kefir stream with announcements like these.

Export a function that takes this stream, and returns a stream of each cookie's deliciousness.

You can pass your stream like this:

  module.exports = function(stream) {
    stream.map(somethingToMapThrough)
  }
