you'll get another stream of numbers, but this time they'll be totes random

for example,

--5--8---3--19--4--35---X

lets use `filter` to turn this stream of random-ass numbers into a stream 
of prime numbers!!

--5------3--19----------X

let's see how we'd filter out odds (those will never be prime, anyway):

  function odds = function (x) {
    if (x % 2 !== 0) return x
  }
  
  stream.filter(odds)

you might want to use the npm module `is-prime`
	
  npm install is-prime

write a program that exports a function. this function should take a stream, 
and returns a stream of primes.

save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.
