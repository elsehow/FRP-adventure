Kefir streams expose a function called `filter`. 

If I have a stream like this:

  --1--2---3--4--5--6---X

I can use `filter` to get only the odd elements

  module.exports = function (stream) { 

    function odds (x) { if (x % 2 !== 0) return x }
      
    return stream.filter(odds)
  }

Then I'll get this stream:

  --1------3-----5------X

*  *  *  

We get a lot of garbage cookie announcements. I want an alert every time a batch is cooked the deliciousness of which is greater than 6.

For each delicious batch, I want a string of the form:

  "[batch.baker]'s [batch.flavor] cookies are delicious"

Using `filter` and `map`, give me such a stream. Again, I'll give you a stream of cookie announcements.

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.
