NICE! here was my solution:

  function delicious (cookies) {
    if (cookies.deliciousness > 6) 
      return cookies
  }

  var deliciousnessAlert = function (c) {
    return c.baker + "'s " + c.type + " cookies are delicious."
  }

  module.exports = function (batch) {
    return batch.filter(delicious).map(deliciousnessAlert)
  }


CRYPTIC KOAN

You can think of streams as an assembly line. By chaining `map`s and `filter`s, we can describe a sequence of procedures that happen to each item in the line. (In time you'll see that we can split and merge these assembly lines, as well).
