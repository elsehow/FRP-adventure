Let's say we have two streams: a stream of button presses, and a stream of messages.

I want to highlight a message every time a press the button, I can do:

  var highlighted = messages.sampledBy(buttonPresses).

e.g., 

  messages       -----a-b-c---X
  buttonPresses  -x-x--x----x-X
  highlighted    ------a----c-X

Personally, I have several thoussand ovens, all of which are, um, baking batches of cookies on their own.

I have a sort of, well, a sort of cockpit I sit in, where I monitor all of my ovens. 

In HTML, I have a div for every oven. The ID of the div is the ID of the oven.

I want to click each oven div in order to select that oven. 

I can make a stream of selected ovens from my jquery click events:

  var clickStream = Kefir.fromEvents($(document.body), 'click')

  function targetID (ev) {
    return ev.target.id
  }

  clickStream.map(targetID).map(selection)


After a bit of clicking, I'll see a stream that looks like this:

  ---1-----7--19--20-------X

 I also have two buttons, a harvest button (sends a robot to collect a batch) and a reset button (tells the oven to start its operation over with a new, algorithmically generated cookie recipe).


 I will give you three streams: a stream of oven selections, a stream of clicks on the harvest button, and a stream of clicks on the reset button.

   module.exports = function (ovenSelections, harvestClicks, resetClicks) {
     // ..
   }

 Clicking either button will emit a message relating to the currently selected oven:

    { action: 'harvest', id: 91 }

 Where `action` is either 'harvest' or 'reset'.
