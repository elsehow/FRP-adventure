Kefir streams expose a function called `map`. 

If I have a stream like this:

--1--2---3--4--5--6---X

I can use `map` to halve every element that comes through the stream:

  module.exports = function (stream) { 

    function half (x) { return x/2 }
      
    return stream.map(half)
  }

Export a function that takes a stream and returns a stream (like the above 
example), except, rather than halving allelements that come through 
the stream, square them. 

Save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.

Don't overthink this.
