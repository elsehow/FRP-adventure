the ICFS (International Cookie Friendship Society) is a nationwide initiative.

thousands of volunteers from around the globe bake cookies. 

given that this effort is massively distributed, and done mostly in volunteers' free time, we have no idea when a new batch will be released.

the way the system works is: whenever someone releases a new batch of cookies, they emit a JSON announcement over a shared channel. announcements look slike this:

  {
    "baker": "gsussman",
    "type": "gingerbread",
    "deliciousness": 7
  }


you will be given a stream of cookie announcements:

-----c----c-----c-----------c-----c-c----------c-----

where each c is a JSON string

filter this stream so that it only includes cookies whose deliciousness is > 6. return a stream of strings describing the delicious cookies.

strings should be of the form "gsussman's gingerbread cookies are delicous."

hint: start by parsing the JSON:

  stream.map(JSON.parse)
