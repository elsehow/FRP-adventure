i have been working hard on our cookie operation. [hydroponic cookie farm.]

i found a warehouse in west oakland and setup a vertical farm where we can grow batches of cookies from customized genetic stock. the batches are watched by tesel2 boards, each of which has two sensors that let us estimate deliciousness of the batch at any given time. 

sensor A samples 512Hz (that's 512 readings a second), and sensor B samples at 2048Hz. 

A_stream  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaX
B_stream  -b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bX

`combine` these streams using this deliciousness estimator:

  function deliciousness_estimate (a, b) {
    return (a*Math.LN2) * (3 / b)
  }

this will give you a stream of deliciousness estimates coming in at a cool 1024Hz. 

return an average deliciousness estimate at a much cooler 2Hz (twice per second). 

finally, Math.round each average.

at the end, your stream should return about two integer every second.

starter code:

  module.exports = function (A_stream, B_stream) {
    // ..
  } 

hints:

* use `bufferBy` and `Kefir.interval` to help you find the average

* the module average might come in handy for that, too:

  npm install average
